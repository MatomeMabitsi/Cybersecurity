## 📊 Splunk SIEM Investigation

### Overview
Splunk was used to ingest and analyze authentication and access logs to detect suspicious behavior and potential security incidents.

### Activities Performed
- Log ingestion and indexing  
- SPL (Search Processing Language) queries  
- Authentication and access log analysis  
- Detection of brute-force and anomalous login behavior  
- Alert creation and dashboard analysis  

### Investigation Notes
- Compared failed versus successful login attempts  
- Identified suspicious IP addresses generating repeated failures  
- Detected abnormal login patterns outside expected behavior  
- Correlated events across multiple log sources to validate findings  
- Documented results using SOC-style investigation methodology

## 🛡 Wazuh SIEM / HIDS Investigation

### Overview
Wazuh was used for **host-based intrusion detection**, security monitoring, and system integrity analysis.

### Activities Performed
- Deployment and management of Wazuh agents  
- Host-based log collection and monitoring  
- Security alert review and severity assessment  
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
- Authentication and system event analysis  

### Investigation Notes
